The script contest.sh is intended to judge answers in a programming contest.

The correct answers are contained in the directory "answer", with the filename 00.txt holding the answer for question 0.

The contestants will submit a file named 00contestant.  The script will use the first two digits to find the answer file, and then compare the two files.
