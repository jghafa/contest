Programming Contest Rules

Contest overview:

Teams can solve problems by any means necessary. That means any programming language is allowed, any hardware is allowed, any and all reference materials are allowed, texting your smarter older sister for a clue is allowed.

Teams must bring their own development systems.  That system must be able to read and write the problems and solutions, i.e. read and write text files to a USB flash drive.

Contest problem descriptions and problem inputs will be supplied on USB flash drives.

Contest problem output will be given to the judges on flash drives.  Judges will return the flash drives after copying the submitted solutions.

Contest problem descriptions, problem inputs, and problem output are all text files.

Since problems are submitted via text files, and since any system may be used, your submitted files may use lines separated by Windows conventions (CR LF, 0x0D 0xoA), Unix conventions (LF, 0xoA), or Mac conventions (CR, 0x0D).

The contest problem solutions will be judged by a UNIX Bash script that compares the submitted output file to a reference output file.  The standard UNIX command "DIFF -w" will do the actual comparison, so code your programs accordingly.

Sample problems and the contest judging script are available online at https://github.com/jghafa/contest



Contest Scoring

The contest problems will have varying degrees of difficultly.

Each contest problem will have a base score and more difficult problems will score higher.

The first correct solution scores triple the base score, the second scores double, and all subsequent correct answers get the base score.
The time of submittal is determined by the time stamp of the solution file on the judge's computer.



Submitting an solution with malware anywhere on the media will disqualify the team.

Teams will submit the source code along with the solution file.
