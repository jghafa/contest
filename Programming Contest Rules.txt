Programming Contest Outline

Contest overview:

Teams can solve problems by any means necessary. That means any programming language is allowed, any hardware is allowed, any and all reference materials are allowed, texting your smarter older sister for a clue is allowed.

Teams must being their own development systems.  That system must be able to read and write the problems and solutions, i.e. read and write a USB flash drive.

Contest problem descriptions and problem inputs will be supplied on USB flash drives.

Contest problem output will be given to the judges on flash drives.  Judges will return the flash drives after copying the submitted solutions.

Contest problem descriptions, problem inputs, and problem output are all text files.

The contest problem solutions will be judged by a Bash script that compares the submitted output file to a reference output file.  The standard unix command “DIFF -w” will do the actual comparison, so code your programs accordingly.

Sample problems and the contest judging script are available online at https://github.com/jghafa/contest

Contest Scoring

The contest problems will have varying degrees of difficultly.

Each contest problem will have a base score and more difficult problems will score higher.

The first correct solution scores triple the base score, the second scores double, and all subsequent correct answers score the base.

Ties are broken by the time to submit the correct solution.

 

Submitting an solution with malware anywhere on the media will disqualify the team.

Teams will submit the source code along with the solution file.
